This project aims to use Python content analysis to test the idea that such social institutions like “democracy” or “constitutionalism” have different range of meanings in the minds of ordinary people in different countries. For this project, the hypothesis is simple: people living in developing countries with less developed democracy tend to incorporate certain elements that are not essential to the proper meaning of democracy. For example, people living in India or Pakistan tend to associate other desirable things with the idea of democracy, such as electricity, toilet, sanitation, free wifi and prosperity.

I wish to first extract 20000 twitters with “#democracy” and write them into a csv file. 10000 of them are from US users and another 10000 can be from India or Pakistan (we can test India first). Then we can use pyentropy or/and NLTK to rank some of the most related words with “#democracy”. Of course, we have to exclude some words like “the”, “of”, “with”, etc that do not have any relationship with the idea of democracy. Then we can get a cleaned csv file, with words ranked according to their frequency with the #democracy. What I want to achieve is when I type in the word, for example, “electricity”, there will return the “ranking” and “probability” of this word in relation to #democracy. The expectation is the words like “electricity” or “free wifi” have higher ranking and probability rate in India than in the US, while words like “election” or “voting” may be the other way around. This project can be made more flexible and interactive so that I can experiment other words like “#constitutionalism” or other countries like “Germany”, etc to test the hypothesis.
